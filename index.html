    <h1><strong>PIAIC</strong></h1>
    <h2>Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing.</h2>
    <p>
        PIAIC is an initiative by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to promote the development and
        implementation of artificial intelligence and computing (AI/CC)<br> in developing countries. The goal is to
        increase the number of people with advanced computing skills, improve productivity, and reduce poverty.

    <h1>Cloud Native Computing</h1>
    <p>
        Cloud native computing is a model of computing that makes use of containerization, service meshes, and
        Kubernetes to deploy and manage applications on platforms like <br>Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Microsoft Azure.
        It is designed to be loosely coupled, modular, and easily scalable, making it easier to build, deploy, <br>and manage applications
        on the cloud.
    </p>

    <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
    <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that focuses on developing computer programs that can
        learn from, understand, and make decisions with data. AI has been used to automate tasks, improve decision-making, and
        improve various fields, including healthcare, finance, and education.
    </p>

    <h1>Blockchain</h1>
    <p>
        Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that uses a cryptographic algorithm to securely record transactions and
        maintain a record of all transactions made on the network. Blockchain allows for secure, transparent, and tamper-proof
        transactions, making it a valuable tool for various applications, such as finance, supply chain management, and voting.
    </p>

    <h1>Internet Of Things</h1>
    <p>
        Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of interconnected devices, sensors, and other objects that use the internet to
        exchange data and communicate with each other. IoT has revolutionized various industries, such as manufacturing, transportation, and healthcare, by enabling smart devices to communicate with each other and create new opportunities for innovation and collaboration.
